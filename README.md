# STM Data Toolkit (minimal notebooks)

Small, self-contained notebooks for common STM/AFM post-processing tasks.  
Only a few example figures are shown; raw data and low-level details are intentionally omitted.

- **Focus:** topography detrending, dI/dV linecuts, simple coverage estimation (AFM edge detection).
- **Design goals:** tiny, reproducible, easy to skim; keep repository size small (notebooks saved with cleared outputs).
